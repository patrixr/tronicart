# Tronicart - Creative Workspace

[![CI](https://github.com/patrixr/tronicart/actions/workflows/publish.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/patrixr/tronicart/actions/workflows/publish.yml)

This repo is designed for creative coding, mainly with P5.js, but not limited to it. It uses pnpm as a package manager and Turbo Repo as a monorepo tool. Sketches are located in the `/sketches` folder, while reusable packages are located in the `/packages` folder.

Here are a few sketch outputs I've generated thanks to these tools:
